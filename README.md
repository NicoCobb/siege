<img src="https://github.com/NicoCobb/siege/blob/797e6cf8d2c71e31732041b7e3fed4109f3c2efb/Sample_card.png" height="400" />

1. A unit's card will have an image of a marker that corresponds to this unit. These markers are what will be placed on the board when a unit is played.
2. Certain cards will have ability text. This will be listed underneath the marker image.
3. Every unit has a color value. This will be noted by a colored border on the card. 
   1. Units can be __red, green, blue, or neutral__.
   2. Each color is __effective against__ another color, with the exception of neutral.
      1. __Red__ beats __Green__
      2. __Green__ beats __Blue__
      3. __Blue__ beats __Red__
      4. __Neutral__ is __equal to__ all other colors.
4. Every unit has a cost on it. This will be displayed above where the unit's marker is on the card. (__NOTE: ALL CARDS IN THIS VERSION HAVE A COST OF 0)
   1. 0-cost units will __have no value__ displayed on the card.
   2. A unit's marker will have as many stars on it as it's cost is equal to.
    

## Drafting
1. A coin is flipped to decide who begins drafting first. The same player will make the first move of the game.
2. Seperate the cards into individual piles of each card type. During this phase, place only half of the available cards into the pile.
3. A card is __drafted__ by taking one card from a pile, and placing it into your deck.
4. Each player drafts 15 cards, alternating between each player.

## Setup
1. Once drafting has finished, players may place 4 starting units __of their choice__ under these restrictions:
   1. Units can be placed on any space within a __2-space wide__ radius around the siege tower. 
   2. Players alternate placing units. The player who will be starting places a unit down first. 
   3. Once each player has **4 units down** setup is complete.
2. After each player finishes placing all of their units down, take your remaining drafted units and shuffle them. Place these into a single deck, which will be your deck for the remainder of the game.
  
## Turns
1. __Draw__: Players decide if they would like to either.
   1. Draw up to __five cards__ for their turn.
   2. Draw up to __four cards__ _and_ __draft an additional card__ and __shuffle it__ into your deck.
      1. Choosing to draft also means a player has __one less summoning point__ for this turn.
2. __Summon__: _(see summoning section for specifics)_
3. __Move__: up to 5 of your units. Each unit's move amount will be listed on the card.
   1. Units __CANNOT MOVE ONTO MOUNTAINS.__
4. __Attack__: with up to 5 of your units. These do not necessarily need to be the same units who were moved. _(see attack section for specifics)_

## Summoning
1. Players have 4 summoning points per turn. Summoning a unit will use 1 more point than it's listed cost.
  
## Attack
1. When a unit attacks, the attacking player rolls the number of dice blocks that corresponds to their attack value.
   1. If a player rolls a __4, 5, or 6__ the attack is a __hit__.
   2. If a player rolls a __1, 2, or 3__ the attack is a __miss__.
2. If the attacked unit is not dead, and if the attacked unit __is in range__ to attack back, the attacked unit will counterattack in the same manner.
3. __Modifiers__
   1. If a unit has color advantage when it attacks, it gains __1 additional attack point__.
      1. Consequently, if a unit has color disadvantage when it attacks, it __loses 1 attack point__.
   2. __Terrain__ may also impact a unit's attack.
      1. If a unit attacks a __covered__ unit (a unit who is on a __forest__ space), the attacker must roll a __5, or a 6__ to land a __hit__.

## Win Condition
1. The goal is to be the first player to make it to __20 victory points__.
2. Victory points are earned by spending a turn with a unit on top of a tower.
   1. The two towers _in the center_ are worth __1 point__ per turn.
   2. The _enemy tower_ is worth __10 points__ per turn.
